DOWNLOAD

INSTALLATION
1. Download the latest zip folder and extract the sticker images from the file folder inside.
2. Once extracted, create a new file folder in a USB memory stick and name the new file folder as SHAREfactory.
3. In that file folder, create a new file folder and name it Images. Place the stickers in the Images file folder.
4. Boot up your PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 and start SHAREfactory (called Share Factory Studio on the PlayStation 5).
5. Once in the app, head to Import and then select Import Images. Plug your USB into the USB port and then select Import from USB. This lets you copy available and usable images to be used as stickers in SHAREfactory.
6. You can now use stickers in the video editing tool and the collage editing tool (known as photo editing tool).
